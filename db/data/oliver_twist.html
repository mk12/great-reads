<p>Laevistrombus canarium (commonly known as the dog conch or by its
better-known synonym, Strombus canarium) is a species of edible sea snail, a
marine gastropod mollusc in the family Strombidae (true conches). Known from
illustrations in books dating from the late 17th century, L. canarium is an
Indo-Pacific species occurring from India and Sri Lanka to Melanesia, Australia
and southern Japan. The shell of adult individuals is coloured from light
yellowish-brown to golden to grey. It has a characteristic inflated body whorl,
a flared, thick outer lip and a shallow stromboid notch. The shell is valued as
an ornament, and because it is heavy and compact it is also often used as a
sinker for fishing nets.</p>

<p>The external anatomy of the soft parts of this species is similar to that of
other strombid snails. The animal has an elongate snout, thin eyestalks with
well-developed eyes and sensory tentacles, and a narrow, strong foot with a
sickle-shaped operculum. A molecular analysis conducted in 2006 based on DNA
sequences of histone and mitochondrial genes demonstrated that Laevistrombus
canarium, Doxander vittatus and Labiostrombus epidromis are closely related
species. The dog conch exhibits behaviours common among Strombidae, including
burrowing and a characteristic leaping form of locomotion. The former behaviour,
however, involves movement sequences unique to this species.</p>

<p>Laevistrombus canarium lives on muddy and sandy bottoms, grazing on algae and
detritus. It is gonochoristic and sexually dimorphic, depending on internal
fertilization for spawning. Larvae of this species spend several days as
plankton, undergoing a series of transformations until they reach complete
metamorphosis. The maximum life span is 2 to 2.5 years. Predators of this snail
include carnivorous gastropods such as cone snails and volutes. It is also a
prey species for vertebrates including macaques, and also humans, who consume
the soft parts in a wide variety of dishes.</p>
